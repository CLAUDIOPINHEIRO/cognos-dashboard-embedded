# Using the {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}}

{{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_full}} uses the dashboard functionality from IBM Cognos Analytics. How you use a dashboard in Cognos Analytics is explained in the following location [IBM Cognos Analytics - Dashboard documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEP7J_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.ug_ca_dshb.doc/wa_dashboard_discoveryset_intro.html){: new_window}.

There are a couple of differences. {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} does not support:
-	Reporting and modelling.
-	Custom widgets. You cannot extend the set op shapes.
-	Pinned objects. There is no **My pins panel** in Dynamic Dashboard Embedded.
-	Intent based authoring.
