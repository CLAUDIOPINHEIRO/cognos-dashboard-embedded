Virtually every application today has lots of data that can be used to enhance the application userâ€™s insights into the domain of the application. To tap into this value and provide it to their users, the application developer needs to provide a means of showing this raw data through analytics and visualizations.

Whether providing a guided exploration of the analysis through authored fixed dashboards, or providing a more free-form analytic exploration environment to allow their users to find their own insights, {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} provides application developers with a way to add these analytic capabilities to their application.

Adding {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} into an application involves four steps:
1. Creating an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account and provisioning a {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} service instance.
2. Creating a service credential to access the service instance API.
3. Creating a {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} session from your web service application.
4. Adding {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} into your web client application through the {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} JavaScript API.
