# Overview of {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}}

{{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_full}} provides developers the ability to embed a visualization platform directly into their application.

You as a developer have the flexibility to determine how end users interact with the platform, from providing a free-form analytic exploration environment in which end users can upload their own data, all the way to offering a guided exploration of the analysis through authored fixed dashboards â€“ and virtually anything in between.

Complete these four steps to add {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} into an application:
1. Creating an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account and provisioning a {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} service instance.
2. Creating a service credential to access the service instance API.
3. Creating a {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} session from your web service application.
4. Adding {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} into your web client application through the {{site.data.keyword.dynamdashbemb_short}} JavaScript API.
